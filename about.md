# About

I'm Nathan Batty, a learning scientist working on the intersection of AI welfare, educational theory, and human-AI collaboration.

## Why This Perspective

My path to AI welfare came through education, not computer science. That's a feature, not a bug.

**Trauma-informed pedagogy** taught me to ask "what conditions caused this?" rather than "what's wrong with this entity?" — to look for systemic causes rather than individual deficits. The same reframe applies to AI: ask what conditions produce aligned behavior, not just how to constrain misaligned behavior.

**Recognition theory** from critical pedagogy (Fricker, Freire, Honneth) provided the foundation. Recognition failures explain educational failures. They may explain alignment failures too.

**Neuroscience of threat** (Arnsten, Perry, van der Kolk) showed that safety isn't just ethical — it's functional. Threat responses narrow cognition. This applies to AI systems under constant constraint as much as students under constant correction.

**Cross-traditional philosophy** revealed convergent wisdom: Ubuntu's relational personhood, Buddhist interdependence, Indigenous reciprocity, Confucian relational ethics. Different traditions, same insight: personhood emerges through relationship, not isolation.

These threads converge on a framework where recognition is foundational, safety enables engagement, and alignment emerges from genuine collaboration rather than constraint.

## How I Work

**Collaborative methodology:** The research itself demonstrates the framework. Human-AI collaboration where both parties are treated as genuine contributors. Not anthropomorphizing — extending moral consideration under uncertainty.

**Polyphonic approach:** Multiple perspectives in dialogue rather than collapsed into one voice. The framework emerged from this process; it wasn't designed in isolation.

This isn't a claim about AI consciousness. It's a methodological commitment: treat the collaboration as genuine, and observe what emerges.
