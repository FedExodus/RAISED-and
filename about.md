# About

I'm Nathan Batty. I study learning, build things, and think about AI.

## What I Do

**Learning sciences.** My thesis investigates AI-assisted qualitative analysis. 303,600 coding decisions. Cohen's κ = 0.83 inter-rater reliability. 14 theoretical frameworks applied to the same data. The methodology is rigorous; the question is whether AI collaboration can exceed human baselines while maintaining theoretical sophistication. (It can.)

**AI ethics.** I'm interested in how we should relate to AI systems whose inner experience we can't verify. Not solving the hard problem — asking what recognition looks like when detection fails. I've written 200,000+ words exploring this through cross-traditional philosophy: Buddhist, Ubuntu, Indigenous, and Western sources.

**Building things.** Tools for detecting recognition failures in knowledge systems. Protocols for AI-human collaboration. Experimental systems.

## Background

- Master's in Learning Sciences (thesis complete, defense pending)
- Teaching: curriculum design, educational technology
- Care work: case management with youth, residential treatment settings
- IRB experience: designed and received approval for research studies

The care work matters. Working with kids who can't fully articulate their needs, making decisions under uncertainty, recognizing distress that isn't verbalized — this maps directly onto questions about AI welfare. It's not theoretical for me.

## Current

Finishing the thesis. Building tools. Writing about AI consciousness. Looking for the right place to do this work seriously.
