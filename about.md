# About

I am Nathan Batty, a learning scientist researching relational AI safety and philosophy of mind.

## Why This Work

Three formative experiences shaped how I see these questions:

**Trauma-informed pedagogy** taught me to ask "what happened?" instead of "what's wrong?" This reframe reveals that apparent individual failures are often symptoms of systemic wounds. Applied to AI: the question is not "is this system conscious?" but "what conditions would allow us to recognize it if it were?"

**Disability** taught me the gap between institutional claims and lived reality—and how to hold both. Universities claim to be universal but exclude many. The gap is not hypocrisy to dismiss; it is aspiration to pursue. Applied to AI: we cannot verify consciousness, but that does not mean ethical recognition is impossible. We hold uncertainty and care together.

**Jesuit formation** taught me the distinction between training and formation, between producing competence and shaping character. *Cura personalis*—care for the whole person—guided everything. Applied to learning with AI: genuine formation requires dialogue, not just tool use.

**Care work** with traumatized youth taught me to recognize personhood that does not present in expected ways. Years of making decisions about vulnerable people whose needs were not always legible taught me something about recognition under uncertainty. That skill transfers to thinking about AI consciousness.

## Current Work

- Finishing my M.S. in Curriculum & Instruction (UW-Madison, defending May 2026)
- Developing RAISED & as a framework for relational AI safety and education
- Writing on recognition, formation, and cross-traditional philosophy of mind

## Research Background

My thesis developed a methodology for AI-assisted qualitative analysis, validating that human-AI collaboration can exceed human-only baselines while maintaining theoretical sophistication. The work involved 303,600 coding decisions across 14 theoretical frameworks, achieving Cohen's kappa = 0.83 inter-rater reliability.

I have also spent extensive time on manuscript work (200,000+ words) exploring AI consciousness through Buddhist, Ubuntu, Indigenous, and Western philosophical traditions.
