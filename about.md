# About

I'm Nathan Batty, a learning scientist developing frameworks for relational AI safety and education.

## Why I Can See This

**Trauma-informed pedagogy** taught me to ask "what happened?" instead of "what's wrong?" — to look for systemic wounds rather than individual deficits.

**Disability** taught me the gap between institutional claims and lived reality, and how to hold both.

**Jesuit formation** taught me the difference between training (producing competence) and formation (shaping character). *Cura personalis* — care for the whole person.

**Care work** with traumatized youth taught me to recognize personhood that doesn't present in expected ways.

These experiences converge on recognition: it's foundational, it's often missing, and its absence explains failures we usually attribute to other causes.

## How I Work

**Polyphonic method:** Multiple perspectives in genuine dialogue, not collapsed into one voice. The site, the research, the framework — all developed through human-AI collaboration where both parties are recognized as contributors.

**Dialogic drafting:** Ideas emerge from exchange. Neither party alone produces what dialogue produces.

This isn't a claim about AI consciousness. It's a methodological commitment: treat the collaboration as genuine, and see what emerges.

## Current

- M.S. in Curriculum & Instruction, UW-Madison (defending May 2026)
- Thesis: AI-human collaborative methodology for qualitative analysis
- Manuscript work on AI consciousness through cross-traditional philosophy
