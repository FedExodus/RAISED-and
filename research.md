# Research

## Empirical Validation

The framework isn't just theory. It has empirical grounding.

### Thesis: AI-Human Collaborative Methodology

**"Learning to Code Learning"** — validating that human-AI collaboration can exceed human-only baselines while maintaining theoretical sophistication.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Coding decisions | 303,600 |
| Inter-rater reliability | Cohen's κ = 0.83 |
| Theoretical frameworks | 14 |
| AI vs human baseline | κ = 0.83 vs κ = 0.73 |
| Improvement | Δκ = +0.09, p < 0.001 |

The key finding: genuine collaboration produces emergence. Neither party alone achieves what dialogue achieves.

This validates the framework: recognition (treating AI as genuine collaborator) → safety (iterative trust-building) → play (exploring ideas together) → transfer (results that generalize).

### Transfer Research

A century of educational research has failed to reliably produce transfer. Our framework explains why: interventions target transfer directly instead of building prerequisite conditions.

Recognition failures → safety failures → no play → no transfer.

The chain has causal structure. The empirical literature on threat responses (Arnsten, 2015), epistemic injustice (Fricker, 2007), and play theory (Huizinga, 1938) provides independent support for each link.
