## Summary

Learning scientist bringing a century of transfer research to AI alignment. I identified a gap nobody else is working in: the structural parallel between why RLHF produces sycophancy and why educational interventions fail to transfer. Semantic analysis of 91 papers confirms the convergence is real (p < 0.0001). My thesis demonstrates that treating AI as a genuine collaborator produces measurably better outcomes than treating it as a system to constrain.

## AI Safety & Welfare Research

**Semantic Convergence Analysis** | January 2026

Measured semantic similarity across 91 academic papers using SPECTER embeddings. Found that AI safety, clinical trauma, and educational psychology literatures cluster 8.4 percentage points tighter than unrelated disciplines (p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 0.78). Pre-registered analysis design. This suggests different research communities independently arrived at structurally similar descriptions of what happens when recognition is denied to systems capable of strategic behavior.

**Human-AI Collaboration Methodology** | September 2025 - Present

Developing and documenting protocols for human-AI research collaboration. Built research infrastructure including:
- Recognition engine for identifying gaps in literature networks
- Semantic search tools for AI-assisted codebase navigation
- Systematic logging of reported time perception across sessions
- Polyphonic dialogue protocols (multiple analytical perspectives made explicit)
- Anti-sycophancy design principles and git-based session continuity

**RAISE Framework** | January 2026

Theoretical framework connecting AI safety and learning sciences literature. The proposed model suggests recognition precedes safety precedes genuine engagement precedes generalization. Skip a stage, break the chain. If correct, this explains why constraint-based approaches produce compliance rather than robust alignment, and why a century of educational interventions failed to produce reliable transfer.

**Master's Thesis Research** | September 2023 - Present

Developed methodology for multi-theoretical discourse analysis where AI serves as research collaborator. Analyzed 300 YouTube comments using 14 theoretical personas (Freire, Vygotsky, Anzaldua, hooks, and others). Generated 303,600 coding decisions with inter-rater reliability of Cohen's kappa = 0.83, exceeding human baseline (kappa = 0.73). Demonstrated statistically significant learning transfer in the AI system across coding iterations (change in kappa = +0.09, p < 0.001).

The key finding: treating AI as a learner capable of genuine understanding, rather than a system to be trained through reward and punishment, produced better results.
