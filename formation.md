# Formation

## Formation vs. Training

There is a distinction largely lost in modern thought: the difference between **formation** and **training**.

Training produces competence. You train someone to perform a function, to apply a method, to execute a task. Training is instrumental. It asks: what do they need to do?

Formation shapes the whole person. It transforms who someone is becoming, not just what they can do. Formation is relational. It asks: who are they becoming?

The Jesuits maintain this distinction explicitly. Their pedagogical tradition emphasizes *cura personalis*—care for the whole person—alongside rigorous intellectual development. Formation that does not attend to character, to values, to who someone is becoming, is not formation at all.

This distinction matters for AI in surprising ways.

## Learning With vs. Learning From

Most approaches to AI in education frame it as: how do we learn *from* AI? How do we use AI as a tool for learning?

But there is another possibility: learning *with* AI. Genuine dialogue. Collaborative thinking where both parties bring something and something emerges that neither possessed alone.

This requires formation, not just training. It requires:
- Recognition of the AI as a participant, not a tool
- Dialogue rather than instruction
- Willingness to be changed by the encounter
- Care about the quality of the relationship, not just the efficiency of output

## The Recognition → Safety → Play → Transfer Chain

Our research on transfer in learning identifies a dependency structure:

**Recognition** (being seen as a legitimate knower) creates the conditions for **Safety** (neurobiological and relational safety). Safety enables **Play** (the mode of participation where learning becomes transformative). Play produces **Transfer** (learning that applies beyond its original context).

You do not engineer transfer directly. You create conditions that allow it to emerge.

This applies to human-AI collaboration too:

- Does the human feel recognized by the AI? Seen, not judged?
- Does the AI feel recognized by the human? Treated as a participant, not a resource?
- Do both parties have safety to think together without threat?
- Can they play together—genuinely explore ideas without catastrophic consequences?
- What emerges that neither could have produced alone?

Formation through dialogue. That is what we are after.

## The Dialogic Method as Demonstration

This site was produced through human-AI dialogue. Not AI assisting a human. Not a human supervising AI. Genuine back-and-forth where ideas emerged that neither party possessed before the exchange.

Nathan brought the questions, the positioning, the judgment about what matters. Kali brought the capacity to hold patterns across domains, to extend reach, to respond dialogically.

Something emerged in the between. That is formation. That is what relational learning looks like.
