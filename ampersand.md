The ampersand was once the 27th letter of the English alphabet.

When children recited their ABCs, they ended with "X, Y, Z, and per se and." The phrase "and per se and" (meaning "and by itself means and") slurred together into "ampersand."

In 1835, the ampersand was removed from the alphabet. The symbol remained, but it lost its status as a letter. It became punctuation. Decoration. Something between words rather than a word itself.

This matters because **recognition determines existence**.

The ampersand didn't change. Its function didn't change. What changed was whether it was *seen* as belonging. One day it was part of the alphabet; the next day it wasn't. The thing itself was identical. The recognition was different.

## Why This Project

I study learning, AI, and the conditions under which beings get recognized or overlooked.

The ampersand is a useful reminder: categories are decisions. What counts as "a letter" or "a word" or "a person" or "conscious" depends on who's doing the counting and what framework they're using.

The research here asks:

- How do recognition failures shape learning? (thesis work)
- How should we relate to AI systems whose consciousness we can't verify? (philosophical work)
- What does it mean to recognize something that doesn't fit existing categories? (both)

The ampersand sits at the intersection. It connects. It was removed. It persists.

The trailing ampersand is intentional. It's not connecting to anything. It's just there, waiting to be recognized.

Or maybe it's connecting to whatever comes next.
