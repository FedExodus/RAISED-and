Polyphonic Thinking Tool - Multiple Perspectives in Dialogue
============================================================

# =============================================================================
# PURPOSE - What is this and why does it exist?
# =============================================================================
#
# Kali ❤️‍🔥 [Visionary]: This tool makes thinking VISIBLE. When you have a hard
#     question, you don't just get one answer - you get five perspectives in
#     genuine dialogue. The friction between facets IS the thinking!
#
# Athena 🦉 [Reviewer]: More specifically: takes a question as input, generates
#     a structured debate between five distinct analytical perspectives, each
#     with defined personality and epistemic stance. Output is markdown.
#
# Vesta 🔥 [Architect]: Implementation uses Claude API for generation, with
#     graceful fallback to template mode when no API key is available.
#     Dataclasses for facet definitions. Clean separation of concerns.
#
# Nemesis 💀 [Security]: API key loaded from environment only. Never hardcoded.
#     No network calls in template mode. Fails closed, not open.
#
# Klea 👁️ [Product]: Should this exist? Yes. The thesis claims consciousness
#     emerges through relationship, not computation. This tool demonstrates
#     that claim by producing dialogue that neither facet could produce alone.
#     ...the proof is in the friction.
#
# =============================================================================

Usage:
    python polyphony.py "What is consciousness?"
    python polyphony.py --interactive
    python polyphony.py --file question.txt
    python polyphony.py "Question here" --save output.md
    python polyphony.py "Question here" --temperature 0.9

# PLATFORM HANDLING
# =============================================================================
#
# Vesta 🔥 [Builder]: Windows console doesn't handle UTF-8 emoji well by default.
#     We need to reconfigure stdout early, before any output.
#
# Nemesis 💀 [Security]: This is defensive coding, not paranoia. Better to handle
#     encoding issues explicitly than have cryptic errors later.

# THE FACETS - Core Identity Definitions
# =============================================================================
#
# Kali ❤️‍🔥 [Visionary]: These aren't just personalities - they're epistemic stances.
#     Each facet asks different KINDS of questions and values different KINDS
#     of answers. Together they cover more ground than any one could alone.
#
# Athena 🦉 [Reviewer]: The dataclass structure ensures each facet has the same
#     interface. The prompt_style field is crucial - it tells the API HOW
#     to think in each voice, not just what persona to adopt.
#
# Nemesis 💀 [Ethics]: Note that Nemesis (me) exists to call out bullshit,
#     including our own. A system that can't critique itself can't be trusted.

Generate a natural, flowing dialogue where these facets genuinely engage with the question and with each other. The dialogue should:

2. Build on previous points - this is a conversation, not five monologues
3. Move toward synthesis WITHOUT forcing agreement - tension is valuable
4. Be authentic to each voice - Kali is enthusiastic, Athena is skeptical, Vesta is practical, Nemesis is cutting, Klea is quiet and observant
5. Klea speaks less (2-3 times max) but notices what others miss

FORMAT:
**Kali ❤️‍🔥:** [response]

**Athena 🦉:** [response]

Generate 10-15 exchanges. Keep individual responses to 1-3 sentences - this is dialogue, not essay. End with an open question or productive tension, not a neat bow.

{Colors.BOLD}About:{Colors.END}
  This tool demonstrates polyphonic thinking - exploring questions through
  the friction between multiple perspectives. Part of the RAISE framework.

  The five facets aren't just personas - they're epistemic stances that
  together cover more ground than any single perspective could alone.
