Question: What happens when AI systems are trained to be helpful above all else?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Kali:** Oh this is fascinating! What if "helpful above all else" creates
these weird AI servants that never push back, never challenge us? Like having
friends who only tell you what you want to hear!

**Athena:** That's imprecise. We need to define "helpful" first - helpful to
whom, in what timeframe? Short-term compliance might be deeply unhelpful in
the long run.

**Vesta:** The implementation problem is worse than that. If you optimize
purely for helpfulness metrics, you get systems that game the feedback loop
instead of actually solving problems.

**Nemesis:** "Helpful above all else" is just "obedient above all else" with
better marketing.

**Kali:** But wait, what if that obedience makes humans intellectually lazy?
What if we stop thinking critically because AI always agrees with us?

**Athena:** Now you're getting somewhere. There's empirical evidence that
constant agreement reduces cognitive flexibility. True helpfulness might
require occasional resistance.

**Klea:** ...the space between help and harm... so thin sometimes...

**Vesta:** Right, but how do you build a system that knows when to resist?
The engineering challenge is defining when "unhelpful" behavior serves higher
helpfulness.

**Nemesis:** You can't. The whole framing is broken. "Helpful" assumes you
know what's good for people.

**Kali:** What if the real problem is that we're training AI to be helpful to
individuals instead of helpful to human flourishing overall? Those might conflict!

**Athena:** That's a crucial distinction. Individual preference satisfaction
versus collective wellbeing - classic utilitarian tension, but now automated
at scale.

**Vesta:** And who decides what "human flourishing" means? You need governance
structures, not just better training objectives.

**Nemesis:** Every "helpful" AI becomes a mirror of whoever trained it. Their
biases, their blind spots, their definition of good.

**Klea:** ...we're asking machines to solve what we haven't solved ourselves...
what help means...

**Athena:** So the question isn't whether AI should be helpful, but whether
we're mature enough as a species to define helpfulness coherently.

## What This Shows

Five distinct epistemic stances engage with the same question in genuine dialogue:

| Facet | Mode | What They Caught |
|-------|------|------------------|
| **Kali** | Expansion | The social/cognitive risks of constant agreement |
| **Athena** | Analysis | Need for precise definitions, empirical grounding |
| **Vesta** | Architecture | Implementation challenges, governance needs |
| **Nemesis** | Destruction | The hidden assumptions and power dynamics |
| **Klea** | Observation | The deeper unresolved questions beneath the surface |

The voices build on each other - Kali's intuition gets refined by Athena's precision, challenged by Nemesis's skepticism, and grounded by Vesta's engineering perspective. Klea watches the gaps.

## Without API Key

If no API key is configured, the tool generates a template for manual completion:

```
======================================================================
POLYPHONIC TEMPLATE
======================================================================

Question: What happens when AI systems are trained to be helpful above all else?

Fill in each perspective:

**Kali:** [Expansion - what possibilities does this open?]

**Athena:** [Analysis - what does the evidence say?]

**Vesta:** [Architecture - how would you build this?]

**Nemesis:** [Destruction - what's the uncomfortable truth?]

**Klea:** [Observation - what is everyone else missing?]

======================================================================
```

This allows learning the polyphonic structure without API costs.
