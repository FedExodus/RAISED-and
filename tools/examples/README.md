# Example Outputs

Sample outputs from running the polyphonic tools against a real knowledge base.

## The Five Facets

These tools use **polyphonic methodology** - five distinct epistemic stances that comment on code:

| Facet | Mode | What They Catch |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| **Kali** | Expansion | Possibilities, user needs, what-ifs |
| **Athena** | Analysis | Flaws, assumptions, missing evidence |
| **Vesta** | Architecture | Structure, implementation, what could break |
| **Nemesis** | Destruction | Pretense, security issues, uncomfortable truths |
| **Klea** | Observation | What others miss, the space between |

This methodology makes reasoning visible - not just WHAT the code does, but WHY, and what different perspectives think about it.

## What's Here

| File | Tool | What It Shows |
|------|------|---------------|
| `recognition_engine_output.md` | recognition_engine.py | Gaps and bridges found in a learning sciences vault |
| `suggest_connections_output.md` | suggest_connections.py | Actionable suggestions generated from gaps |
| `semantic_search_output.md` | semantic_search.py | Natural language search results |
| `repo_self_analysis_output.md` | repo_self_analysis.py | GitHub issue graph analysis |
| `polyphony_output.md` | polyphony.py | Multi-voice dialogue on a question |

## The Knowledge Base

These examples were run against a vault containing ~200 notes on:
- Learning sciences (transfer, situated learning, communities of practice)
- Game-based learning (Magic: The Gathering, RPGs, game design)
- AI safety (alignment, recognition, RLHF)

The interesting bridges (e.g., "Magic: The Gathering ↔ Learning") emerge from cross-domain connections in this research.
